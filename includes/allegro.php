						<img src="/img/allegro.png" ><p>I was in charge of multiple troubleshooting issues with the CSS of this this website. I was able to quickly find CSS conflicting errors and correct them.  The troubleshooting had to be done on the live website which I was able to seamlessly correct the errors through many different troubleshooting methods. I am also in the process of styling their new shopping cart and mobile website to be completed late this year.</p>
