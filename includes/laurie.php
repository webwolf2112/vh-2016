						<p>I designed and implemented this client website.  I accurately sliced all photoshop graphics, as well as hand coding HTML5, CSS3, Javascript & jQuery.  This website was made to be partially responsive using a CSS grid framework.  As the client preferred to have a separate mobile website I implemented a seperate Jquery mobile version of this website as well.<br/>
