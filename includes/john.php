						<p>I successfully implemented and hand coded a pixel perfect website from the clients mock-up design.  I accurately sliced all photoshop graphics, as well as hand coding HTML5, CSS3, Javascript & jQuery in this website.  This website was made to be partially responsive using a CSS grid framework.  As the client preferred to have a separate mobile website I implemented a jquery mobile version of this website as well.<br/>
