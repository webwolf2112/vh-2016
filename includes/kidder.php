						<img src="/img/kidder.png" ><p>Working in a live environment I am in charge of consistent content and style updates without disruption.  I recently just did several site design changes including the listings on the main page. I successfully set up a Wordpress Blog in a directory file and created a child theme in order to make their current design seamlessly flow into a new Wordpress theme.</p>
